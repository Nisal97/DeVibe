    <b>
        \n \n
        1.Is it safe to use a Bluetooth device near the head? \n \n
    </b>
            Yes it is. Bluetooth is the name of a wireless technology that uses pulsed radio frequency signals. In De-Vibe Class 3 transmitters are used.
    They are the weakest and operate in a range of less than 10 meters and have a peak transmission power of 1 mW. Basically the technology used in De-Vibe
    won\'t give any matters to the health. \n \n \n

    <b>
        2.How much time will the battery last on the device? \n \n
    </b>
            Depends on the battery capacity the user selects when purchasing the device \n \n \n
    <b>
        3.Can we replace the battery if the battery is dead? \n \n
    </b>
            Yes. Batteries can be purchased in any shops which the devices are available. \n \n \n
    <b>
        4.How to pair more than 1 device \n \n
    </b>
            You can only connect to a one device at once. If you want to connect to another device unpair the device and reconnect by using bluetooth. \n \n \n
    <b>
        5.How to Charge the device? \n \n
    </b>
            Can charge the device through the charging port using the DC current or using a power bank. \n \n \n
    <b>
        6.Can we use without a mobile phone?\n \n
    </b>
            Yes. But the controllers are placed in the mobile app. So the User will be able to on/off and to snooze only. \n \n \n
    <b>
        7.What is the Snooze Button used for? \n \n
    </b>
            This button is used to stop the continuously sounds from the different sources in the area. (Ex: Sound of a train)
    When the snooze button is pressed the device will stop vibrating for 10 seconds. \n \n \n
    <b>
        8.How to get the correct threshold level for the app? \n \n
    </b>
            When going to outdoor it is recommended to put the level more than 50%. When inside it is recommended to put the level less than 50%
    But it depends on the sound level. \n \n \n
